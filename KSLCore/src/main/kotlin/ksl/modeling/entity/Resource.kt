/**
 *  A Resource represents a number of common units that can be allocated to entities.  A resource
 *  has an initial capacity that cannot be changed during a replication. This base resource class
 *  can only be busy or idle.
 *
 *  A resource is busy if at least 1 unit has been allocated. A resource becomes busy when it has allocations. If
 *  a seize-request occurs and the resource has capacity to fill it completely, then the request is allocated
 *  the requested amount.  If insufficient capacity is available at the time of the request, then the request
 *  waits until the requested units can be allocated.
 *
 *  If b(t) is the number of units allocated at time t, and c(t) is the current capacity of the resource, then the number of available units,
 *  a(t), is defined as a(t) = c(t) - b(t).  Thus, a resource is idle if
 *  a(t) = c(t).  Since a resource is busy if b(t) > 0, busy and idle are complements of each other. A resource is
 *  either busy b(t) > 0 or idle b(t) = 0.  If a(t) > 0, then the resource has units that can be allocated.
 *
 *  The utilization of a resource is defined as the ratio of the average number of busy units to the average
 *  number of active units.  Units are active if they are part of the current capacity of the resource.
 *
 *  Subclasses of Resource implement additional state behavior.
 *
 *  @param parent the parent holding this resource
 *  @param name the name of the resource
 *  @param capacity the initial capacity of the resource.  Cannot be changed during a replication. The default capacity is 1.
