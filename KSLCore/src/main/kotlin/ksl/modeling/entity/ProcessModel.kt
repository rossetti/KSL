/**
 * A process model facilitates the modeling of entities experiencing processes via the
 * process view of simulation. A ProcessModel has inner classes (Entity, EntityGenerator, etc.)
 * that can be used to describe entities and the processes that they experience. The key class
 * is Entity, which has a function process() that uses a builder to describe the entity's
 * process in the form of a coroutine.  An entity can have many processes described that it
 * may follow based on different modeling logic. A process model facilitates the running
 * of a sequence of processes that are stored in an entity's processSequence property.
 * An entity can experience only one process at a time. After completing the process,
 * the entity will try to use its sequence to run the next process (if available). Individual
 * processes can be activated for specific entities.
 *
 * See **[ksl.modeling.entity.KSLProcessBuilder]** for documentation on the functionality provided for processes.

             *  waiting in a queue, the entity is removed from the queue and no statistics
             *  are collected on its queueing.  If the entity is experiencing a delay,
             *  then the event associated with the delay is cancelled.
             *
