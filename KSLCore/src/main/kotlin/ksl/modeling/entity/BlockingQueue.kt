/**
 * A blocking queue facilitates the exchange of information between two or more
 * entities that are experiencing processes. Note that an entity can experience
 * one process at a time.
 *
 *  If the capacity is finite, then placing an item in the queue may cause
 *  the sender to block its current process.  Receivers of items from the queue may block
 *  if the number of items meeting their requirements are not available at the time of the
 *  request. By default, all queues are FIFO, but their disciplines can be set by the user.
 *  Instances are intended to be used to communicate between KSLProcesses via the shared
 *  mutable state of the queue.  Statistics on blocking and usage of the communication
 *  channel are automatically reported.
 *
 * @param parent the parent of the queue
 * @param capacity the capacity of the queue, by default Int.MAX_VALUE (infinite)
