 *  An allocation represents a distinct usage of a resource by an entity with an amount allocated.

 *  resource result in multiple allocations (when filled).  An allocation is not created until
 *  the requested amount is available.

 *  @param resource the resource associated with the allocation
 *  @param theAmount the amount allocated of the resource to the entity
 *  @param queue the queue that the entity had to wait in when requesting the allocation
 *  @param allocationName the name of the allocation
 *  processed by the resource. The default actions are supplied by the entity associated with the allocation.
