/**
 * This class allows for the periodic generation of events similar to that
 * achieved by "Create" modules in simulation languages. This class works in
 * conjunction with the EventGeneratorActionIfc which is used to listen and
 * react to the events that are generated by this class.
 *
 * Classes can supply an instance of an EventGeneratorActionIfc to provide the
 * actions that take place when the event occurs. Alternatively, if no
 * EventGeneratorActionIfc is supplied, by default the generator(JSLEvent
 * event) method of this class will be called when the event occurs. Thus,
 * subclasses can simply override this method to provide behavior for when the
 * event occurs. If no EventGeneratorActionIfc is supplied and the method generate()
 * method is not overridden, then the events will still occur; however, no
 * meaningful actions will take place.
 *
 * Of particular note is the use of initial parameters:
 *
 * initial time of first event (default = Constant.ZERO)
 * initial time between events (default = Constant.POSITIVE_INFINITY)
 * initial maximum number of events (default = Long.MAX_VALUE)
 * initial ending time (default = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)
 *
 * These parameters control the initial state of the generator at the start
 * of each replication. The generator is re-initialized to these values at
 * the start of each replication. There are also parameters for each of these
 * that can be changed during a replication. The effect of that change
 * is only within the current replication.
 *
 * @param parent the parent model element
 * @param theAction The action supplies the generation logic for reacting to the generated event.
 * @param theTimeUntilTheFirstEvent A RandomIfc object that supplies the time until the first event.
 * @param theTimeBtwEvents A RandomIfc object that supplies the time between
 * events. Must not be a RandomIfc that always returns 0.0, if the maximum
 * number of generations is infinite (Long.MAX_VALUE)
 * @param theMaxNumberOfEvents A long that supplies the maximum number of events to
 * generate. Each time an event is to be scheduled the maximum number of
 * events is checked. If the maximum has been reached, then the generator is
 * turned off. The default is Long.MAX_VALUE. This parameter cannot be
 * Long.MAX_VALUE when the time until next always returns a value of 0.0
 * @param theTimeOfTheLastEvent A double that supplies a time to stop generating
 * events. When the generator is created, this variable is used to set the
 * ending time of the generator. Each time an event is to be scheduled the
 * ending time is checked. If the time of the next event is past this time,
 * then the generator is turned off and the event won't be scheduled. The
 * default is Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
 * @param theName the name of the generator
