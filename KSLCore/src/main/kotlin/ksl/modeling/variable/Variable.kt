/**
 *  Simulation models may use many variables that define the state of the component/system being modeled.
 *  Within the context of stochastic simulation the values of the variables may change during the
 *  execution of a replication (i.e., the generation of a sample path). It is important to ensure that
 *  each replication starts in the same state (i.e., with the same initial conditions).  Thus, if variable
 *  values change during the replication, the value of the variable must be returned to its initial
 *  value prior to the execution of the next replication. The purpose of this class is to facilitate
 *  the specification of the initial value and the resetting to the initial value prior to the experiments and
 *  the future replications.  Additionally, the value of a variable might need to be constrained to
 *  a legally specified range or interval.  Because of the random nature of simulation, model logic
 *  might attempt to set the value of a variable outside its legal set of values.  This class allows
 *  the specification of a valid interval for the variable.  If the user attempts to set the value outside
 *  this interval, then an exception will be thrown.  This facilitates validation of the model.
 *  @author rossetti@uark.edu
 *  @param parent the parent (containing) model element for this variable
 *  @param theInitialValue the initial value, defaults to 0.0
 *  @param allowedDomain the validity interval, defaults to [NEGATIVE_INFINITY, POSITIVE_INFINITY]
 *  @param name The name of the variable will be auto-defined if null.
