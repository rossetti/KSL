/**
 * This class allows the creation of a schedule that represents a list of
 * intervals of time. The starting length of a schedule is
 * 0.0. The length of a schedule depends upon the intervals added to it.
 * The schedule's length encompasses the furthest interval added. If no
 * intervals are added, then the schedule only has its start time and no
 * response collection will occur.
 *
 * The user adds intervals and responses for which statistics need to be collected during the intervals.
 * The intervals within the cycle may overlap in time. The start time
 * of an interval is specified relative to the beginning of the cycle.
 * The length of any interval must be finite.
 *
 * The schedule can be started any time after the start of the simulation.
 * The default starting time of the schedule is time 0.0.
 * The schedule will start automatically at the designated
 * start time.
 *
 * The schedule can be repeated after the cycle length of the schedule is
 * reached. The default is for the schedule to automatically repeat.
 * Note that depending on the simulation run length only a portion of the
 * scheduled intervals may be executed.
 *
 * The classic use case of this class is to collect statistics for each hour of the day.
 * In this case, the user would use the addIntervals() method to add 24 intervals of 1 hour duration.
 * Then responses (response variables, time weighted variables, and counters) can be added
 * to the schedule. In which case, they will be added to each interval. Thus, interval statistics
 * for each of the 24 intervals will be collected for everyone of the added responses.  If more
 * than one day is simulated and the schedule is allowed to repeat, then statistics are collected
 * across the days.  That is, the statistics of hour 1 on day 1 are averaged with the
 * statistics of hour 1 on all subsequent days.
 *
 * This functionality is built on the ResponseInterval class, which can be used separately. In
 * other words, response intervals do not have to be on a schedule. The schedule facilitates
 * the collection of many responses across many intervals.
 *
 * @param parent         the parent model element
 * @param theScheduleStartTime the time to start the schedule, must be finite.
