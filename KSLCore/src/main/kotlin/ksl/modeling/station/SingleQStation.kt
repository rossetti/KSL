/**
 *  Models a simple work station that has a single queue for holding received qObjects
 *  for processing and a simple resource that is used during the processing.
 *
 *  A QObject may have an object that implements the GetValueIfc attached. If so,
 *  the current value from this object is used as the processing time at the station. If
 *  not attached, then the specified processing time for the station will be used. Thus,
 *  a processed QObject instance can bring its own processing time.  In addition, a QObject
 *  may have an instance of a QObjectSenderIfc interface attached. If one is attached, the
 *  sender will be used to determine where to send the qObject. If a sender is
 *  not attached, then the specified next receiver will be used. Thus,
 *  a processed QObject instance can determine where it goes to next after processing.
 *
 *  @param parent the model element serving as this element's parent
 *  @param activityTime the processing time at the station
 *  @param resource the resource to use at the station. The default of null will cause
 *  a resource of capacity 1 to be created and used at the station
 *  @param nextReceiver the receiving location that will receive the processed qObjects
 *  once the processing has been completed. A default of NotImplementedReceiver, indicates that there is no
 *  receiver implemented. If no receiver is present, there will be a run-time error.
 *  @param name the name of the station
