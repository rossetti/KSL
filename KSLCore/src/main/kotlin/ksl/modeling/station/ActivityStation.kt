/**
 *  Models a simple delay.
 *
 *  A QObject may have an object that implements the GetValueIfc attached. If so,
 *  the current value from this object is used as the delay time at the station. If
 *  not attached, then the specified delay time for the station will be used. Thus,
 *  a processed QObject instance can bring its own delay time.  In addition, a QObject
 *  may have a ListIterator<QObjectReceiverIfc> attached. If one is attached, the
 *  iterator will be used to determine where to send the qObject. If an iterator is
 *  not attached, then the specified next receiver (if not null)  will be used. Thus,
 *  a processed QObject instance can determine where it goes to next after processing.
 *
 *  @param parent the model element serving as this element's parent
 *  @param activityTime the delay time at the station
 *  @param nextReceiver the receiving location that will receive the processed qObjects
 *  once the processing has been completed. A default of null, indicates that there is no
 *  receiver. If no receiver is present, the processed qObject are sent silently nowhere.
 *  @param name the name of the station
