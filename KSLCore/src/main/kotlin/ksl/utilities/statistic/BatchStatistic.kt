/**
 * This class automates the batching of observations that may be dependent. It
 * computes the batch means of the batches and reports statistics across the
 * batches. Suppose we have observations, Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), ... Y(n). This class
 * specifies the minimum number of batches, the minimum number of observations
 * per batch, and a maximum batch multiple. The defaults are 20, 16, and 2,
 * respectively. This implies that the maximum number of batches will be 40 =
 * (min number of batches times the maximum batch multiple). The class computes
 * the average of each batch, which are called the batch means.
 *
 * Once the minimum number of observations are observed, a batch is formed. As
 * more and more observations are collected, more and more batches are formed
 * until the maximum number of batches is reached. Then the batches are
 * re-batched down so that there are 20 batches (the minimum number of batches).
 * This re-batching essentially doubles the batch size and halves the number of
 * batches. In other words, each sequential pair of batches are combined into
 * one batch by averaging their batch means. The purpose of this batching
 * process is to break up correlation structure within the data.
 *
 * Confidence intervals and summary statistics can be reported across the batch
 * means under the assumption that the batch means are independent. The lag-1
 * correlation of the batch means is available as well as the Von-Neumann test
 * statistic for independence of the batch means.
 *
 * Creates a BatchStatistic with the given name For example, if
 * minNumBatches = 20 and maxNBMultiple = 2 then the maximum number of
 * batches allowed will be 40. maxNBMultiple must be 2 or more.
