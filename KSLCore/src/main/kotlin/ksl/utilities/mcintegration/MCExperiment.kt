/**
 * Provides for the running of a monte-carlo experiment.
 *
 * The simulation is performed in two loops: an outer loop called the macro replications and an inner loop called the micro replications.
 * The user specifies a desired (half-width) error bound, an initial sample size (k), and a maximum sample size limit (M) for
 * the macro replications.  The initial sample size is used to generate a pilot sample from which an estimate of the number of
 * samples needed to meet the absolute precision criteria. Let's call the estimated sample size, m.  If m > k, then an
 * additional (m-k) samples will be taken or until the error criteria is met or the maximum number of samples M is reached.
 * Thus, if m > M, and the error criterion is not met during the macro replications a total of M observations will be observed.
 * Thus, the total number of macro replications will not exceed M.  If the error criteria is met before M is reached, the
 * number of macro replications will be somewhere between k and M. The total number of macro replications can be
 * found by using the statistic() method to get the macro replication statistics and using the count() method.
 * Let's call the total number of macro replications executed, n.  The reason that the simulation occurs in two loops is
 * to make it more likely that the observed values for the macro replications are normally distributed because they will
 * be the sample average across the micro replications.  Thus, the theory for the stopping criteria and estimation of
 * the number of needed samples will be more likely to be valid.
 *
 * For each of the n, macro replications, a set of micro replications will be executed. Let r be the number of micro replications.
 * The micro replications represent the evaluation of r observations of the Monte-Carlo evaluation.
 *
 * Thus, the total number of observations will be n x r. The number of
 * micro replications is controlled by the user via the microRepSampleSize property. There is no error criteria checking for
 * the micro replications.
 *
 * By default, the number of macro replications should be relatively small and the number of micro
 * replications large.  Specific settings will be problem dependent.  The default initial sample size, k is 30, with a
 * maximum number of macro replications of M = 10000.  The default half-width error bound is 0.001.  The default setting
 * of the number of micro replications, r, is 100.  Again, these are all adjustable by the user.
 *
 * The user can check if the error criteria was met after the evaluation. If it is not met, the user can
 * adjust the initial sample size, desired error, maximum sample size, or number of micro replications and run another evaluation.
 *
 * The statistics associated with the estimate are readily available. The user may
 * reset the underlying random number stream if a reproducible result is desired within the same execution frame.
 *
 * By default, the underlying random number stream is not reset with each invocation of the runSimulation() method.
 * The default confidence level is 95 percent.
 *
 * Be aware that small desired absolute error may result in large execution times.
 *
 * Implementors of subclasses of this abstract base class are responsible for implementing the abstract method,
 * replication(int j). This method is responsible for computing a single evaluation of the simulation model.
