package ksl.app.bundle

/**
 * The interface for a self-describing KSL model bundle.
 *
 * A bundle is a JAR containing one or more `KSLBundledModel` instances plus
 * the metadata needed to discover, identify, and version them. Bundles are
 * declared by a `bundle.toml` manifest inside the JAR (see `BundleLayout`),
 * which the runtime loader decodes into a `ManifestBackedBundle` — the
 * implementation of this interface.
 *
 * This interface is GUI-agnostic by design. The four Swing apps are the
 * first consumer, but the same surface is intended to be consumed by a
 * future REST/gRPC host, an MCP server for agent-callable simulation, and
 * a CLI scripting host. Bundle metadata therefore never carries
 * presentation hints (icons, themes, layout); such concerns live in
 * per-consumer sidecars.
 *
 * Optional metadata (`author`, `homepage`, `license`, `tags`)
 * has defaulted implementations so the SPI may grow in a backward-compatible
 * fashion: new optional members are added with safe defaults, allowing
 * existing bundle implementations to compile unchanged.
