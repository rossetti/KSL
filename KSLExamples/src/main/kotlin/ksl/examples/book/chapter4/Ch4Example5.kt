 * Example 4.5
 *
 * This example illustrates the running of the DriveThroughPharmacyWithQ instance.
 * This example uses a Queue instance to report statistics on the time
 * spent in the queue.
 *
 * The model is run for 30 replications, of length 20,000 minutes, with a
 * warmup of 5000.0 minutes. The number of servers can be supplied. In
 * addition, the user can supply the distribution associated with the time
 * between arrivals and the service time distribution.
