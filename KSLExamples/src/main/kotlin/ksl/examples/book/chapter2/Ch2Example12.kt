/**
 * Example 2.12
 *
 * This example illustrates how to use the classes within the rvariable package.
 * Specifically, a discrete empirical random variable is
 * created and values are obtained via the value property. A discrete
 * empirical random variable requires a set of values and a CDF over the
 * values.
