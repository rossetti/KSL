/**
 * Example 2.22
 * This example illustrates how to make instances of Distributions.
 * Specifically, a binomial distribution is created, and it is used
 * to compute some properties and to make a random variable. Notice
 * that a distribution is not the same thing as a random variable.
 * Random variables generate values. Distributions describe how the
 * values are distributed. Random variables are immutable. Distributions
 * can have their parameters changed.
