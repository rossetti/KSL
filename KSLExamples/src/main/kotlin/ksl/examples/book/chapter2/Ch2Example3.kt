 * Example 2.3
 *
 * This example illustrates how to clone an instance of a stream.
 * This will produce a new stream that has the same underlying state
 * as the current stream and thus will produce exactly the same
 * sequence of pseudo-random numbers. This is one approach
 * for implementing common random numbers.
